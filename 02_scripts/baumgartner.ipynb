    "Imaging spectrometers, often referred to as hyperspectral cameras, are passive optical instruments that measure spectral radiance. One of the most common device concepts is the push-broom design, which requires no moving parts. The principle configuration of a push-broom imaging spectrometer is shown in Fig. 2.1. A telescope creates an intermediate image of the target scene. With a slit a narrow line is cut out from the image. The beam coming through the slit is then collimated and its spectral components are split into different angles by a dispersing element. The dispersing element is usually realized as diffraction grating or a prism. Finally, focusing optics generate an image from the collimated and spectrally dispersed beam on the FPA. Since angles in the beam in front of the focusing optics correspond to wavelengths, positions perpendicular to the slit on the detector correspond to wavelengths in the same way. One single image take therefore has spectral and one-dimensional spatial information. Two-dimensional spatial data is generated by moving the instrument perpendicular to its slit and simultaneously capturing images. The result is a three-dimensional data array.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the object plane, the spatial dimension parallel to the slit (across-track) is denoted as $y^{\\prime}$-axis, while the $x^{\\prime}$-axis is in the direction of motion (along-track). The $x$-, $y$ - and $z$-axes describe the dimensions of the three-dimensional data array. The $y$-axis corresponds to the $y^{\\prime}$-axis of the object plane. Similarly, the $x$-axis is linked to the object plane's $x^{\\prime}$-axis. The\n",

This line is a collimated and the spectral components are split perpendicularly to the slit by a dispersing element. Finally, a focusing optics images the collimated and spectrally dispersed beam a Focal Plane Array (FPA). By moving the instrument along $x^{\\prime}$ and continuous data acquisition a three dimensional data array is generated. Figure taken from [67].\n",

The ground pixel area is the area of one geometric line covered during the acquisition of one frame. Please note that in reality the pixel footprints do not have a rectangular shape. Original figure taken from [67].\n",
    "spectral dimension is referred to as the $z$-axis. The $y$ - and $z$-axis are on the focal plane, where the FPA is located. The across-track angle is given as $\\beta$ and the along-track angle as $\\alpha$, see Fig. 2.2. The entire across-track viewing field is called FoV, while the IFoV is the viewing angle of discrete pixels. The IFoV distinguishes between along- and across-track.\n",

    "In this work, we denote a single detector element as pixel, all pixels in one detector row which collect the same wavelength as spectral channel, and all pixels in one column on which light from the same across-track angle falls as spatial column. One data acquisition of all pixels is called a frame. The consecutive uninterrupted measurement of many frames is denoted as data take.\n",
